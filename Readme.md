# Geo Zoom Game

Zoom out until you recognize the location. I didn't add a scoring system to the
game because I don't want this to be competitive, it should just be a fun thing
to spend a couple of minutes and to discover various places.

To build the game and upload it to a server, run

```bash
./deploy.sh server:base/path
```
